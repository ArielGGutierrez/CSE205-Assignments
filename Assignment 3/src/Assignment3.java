 Description: This txt file elaborates on the ethics of
              software engineers through examples.

1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with 
the public interest.

 -- Caleb is a software engineer working on a new startup 
    company.  He doesn't much income yet so he works on 
    other paid projects in his free time.  He decides to
    accept a project whereby he will develop software that 
    can obtain a person's bank account information. This is
    an example of something that violates this principle.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products 
and related modifications meet the highest professional standards 
possible.

 -- CD Projekt Red was on a time crunch and didn't test nor debug
    their new video game software before release.  This practice 
    violates this principle.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall 
subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of 
software development and maintenance.

 -- Thomas is a manager at a software company that has recently added
    a new rule regarding drinks in the workplace.  He informs his workers
    ahead of time of this new rule change before he holds them accountable.

6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity 
and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

 -- Jose is behind on his code for the software he is developing 
    and he decides to lie to the customer about his progress.  This
    is an example that violates this principle.

7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of 
their colleagues.

 -- John and Matt are coworkers that have a rivalry within the software 
    company they work in in regards to a new promotion.  When Matt tried
    to ask John for help, he refused.  This is an example of something that
    violates this principle.
